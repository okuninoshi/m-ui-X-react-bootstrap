<h4>Component-Based</h4>
<p className="my-4">Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs.</p>
<p>Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM.</p>
